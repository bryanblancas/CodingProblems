Balanced Split
	Given a set of integers (which may include repeated integers), determine if there's a way to split the set into two subsets A and B such that the sum of the integers in both sets is the same, and all of the integers in A are strictly smaller than all of the integers in B.


Signature
	bool balancedSplitExists(int[] arr)


Input
	All integers in array are in the range [0, 1,000,000,000].


Output
	Return true if such a split is possible, and false otherwise.


Example 1
	arr = [1, 5, 7, 1]
	output = true
	We can split the set into A = {1, 1, 5} and B = {7}.

Example 2
	arr = [12, 7, 6, 7, 6]
	output = false
	We can't split the set into A = {6, 6, 7} and B = {7, 12} since this doesn't satisfy the requirement that all integers in A are smaller than all integers in B.
