Minimum Length Substrings

You are given two strings s and t. You can select any 
substring of string s and rearrange the characters of the selected substring. Determine the minimum length of the substring of s such that string t is a substring of the selected substring.

Signature
	int minLengthSubstring(String s, String t)


Input
	s and t are non-empty strings that contain less than 1,000,000 characters each


Output
	Return the minimum length of the substring of s. If it is not possible, return -1

	
Example
	s = "dcbefebce"
	t = "fd"'
	output = 5
	Explanation:
	Substring "dcbef" can be rearranged to "cfdeb", "cefdb", and so on. String t is a substring of "cfdeb". Thus, the minimum length required is 5.
