You are given an array a of N integers. For each index i, you are required to determine the number of contiguous subarrays that fulfills the following conditions:

	The value at index i must be the maximum element in the contiguous subarrays, and
	These contiguous subarrays must either start from or end on index i.


Signature
	int[] countSubarrays(int[] arr)


Input
	Array a is a non-empty list of unique integers that range between 1 to 1,000,000,000
	Size N is between 1 and 1,000,000


Output
	An array where each index i contains an integer denoting the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of a[i]


Example:

	a = [3, 4, 1, 6, 2]
	output = [1, 3, 1, 5, 1]

	Explanation:
	
	For index 0 - [3] is the only contiguous subarray that starts (or ends) with 3, and the maximum value in this subarray is 3.
	For index 1 - [4], [3, 4], [4, 1]
	For index 2 -[1]
	For index 3 - [6], [6, 2], [1, 6], [4, 1, 6], [3, 4, 1, 6]
	For index 4 - [2]
	So, the answer for the above input is [1, 3, 1, 5, 1]
